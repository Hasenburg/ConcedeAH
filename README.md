# ConcedeAH - User Guide

## What is ConcedeAH?
An auction house addon for guild-internal trading in World of Warcraft Classic.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE STARTING

### You must ALWAYS do these manually:
1. **Enter gold yourself** - The addon cannot set gold automatically
2. **Split stacks beforehand** - Items must be in the exact size in your inventory
3. **Maximum 6 items per trade** - For more items, perform multiple trades

### Synchronization Limitation (WoW Classic Limitation):
‚ö†Ô∏è **Auctions and rankings are ONLY transmitted to players in the same zone!**
- New auctions/rankings only reach players in your vicinity
- Players in other zones see updates only after manual sync
- **Solution:** Meet in the same city (e.g., Orgrimmar/Stormwind) and use `/reload` or `/rankingsync`
- This is a WoW Classic API limitation of the GUILD channel

## ‚ö° Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Error**: "I have a 20-stack but should sell 4x 5-stacks"
   - **Solution**: FIRST split into 4x 5-stacks, THEN open trade

2. **Error**: "Gold is not set automatically"
   - **Solution**: Normal! Buyer must ALWAYS enter manually

3. **Error**: "More than 6 auctions simultaneously"
   - **Solution**: Trade first 6, then rest in new trade

4. **Error**: "Other players don't see my auctions"
   - **Solution**: You're in different zones! Meet in the same city

5. **Error**: "Rankings are not up to date"
   - **Solution**: Execute `/rankingsync` in the same zone as other guild members
